# MapsCollection
This is a showcase of all the maps I have created either using ArcGIS online or Packages in R. 

## ArcGIS online 
The History of Mapping Urban Poor in London. Stormap [here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=76ebea822f4c4896adaa98d284a08454) 
-> Critical Geography 

Urban Poverty Mapped by Vulnerability and Access. Stormap [here](https://gtmaps.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=d4653adeec4f4e9b8337354c1e7760d0) 
-> Georeferencing
-> Overlays
-> Buildings colored by distance to facilities
